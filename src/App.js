// A shopping list consists of a set of items associated with a userâ€™s token. Creating a new list consists of the following sequence:

// Generate a new, unique token
// Save the token to localStorage
// Show the user the list view
// The following script should be used to generate a suitable token: src/lib/tokens.js

// AC:

// For users who do not already have a token/list, a button or link exists on the home screen that allows them to create a new list X
// Clicking the button/link generates a new token and saves it to localStorage
// Once the token has been created and saved, the user is redirected to the "list" view
// For users who do have a token already saved in localStorage, they should be shown/redirected to the "list" view
